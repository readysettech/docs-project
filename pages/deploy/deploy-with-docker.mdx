# Deploy With Docker

This guide walks you through how to run ReadySet using Docker, connecting to an existing primary database.

<Callout type ="warning">Before starting, make sure your [upstream database is properly configured.](/deploy/configure-your-database)</Callout>

**1. Download the ReadySet Docker compose file**

```sh
curl -o compose.yml "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readysettech/docs/main/docs/assets/compose.yml"
```

**2. Provide your connection string**

Modify the downloaded compose file to include your database connection string:

```yaml
name: readyset
services:
  readyset:
    ...
    environment:
      # UPSTREAM_DB_URL: <your db url>
  ...
  grafana:
    ...
    environment:
      # UPSTREAM_DB_URL: <your db url>
```
<Callout type="info"> Your connection string should look like ```postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>```</Callout>
<Callout type="warning">If your database is running locally, use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as your host.</Callout>

**3. Start ReadySet!**

In the terminal, run:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

**4. Verify that ReadySet has snapshotted your database**

After connecting, ReadySet will begin taking a snapshot of your underlying database.

For this process to succeed, you must have sufficient disk space to store a copy of your database on the machine where ReadySet is running.

To check ReadySet's status, check the logs for the docker container.

```
docker logs readyset-readyset-1
```

While the snapshot is ongoing, you will see many log messages related to snapshotting progress.

When you see:

```
INFO replicators::noria_adapter: Streaming replication started
```

At this point, ReadySet is ready to start caching queries.

## Next Steps

As a next step, you can [connect to ReadySet from a database shell ](/connect/connect-via-database-shell)or [connect from your application](/connect/connect-an-application-via-an-orm). Once connected, you can start [caching queries](/cache/creating-a-cache).
