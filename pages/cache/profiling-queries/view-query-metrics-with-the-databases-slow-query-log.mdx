# View query metrics with the database's slow query log
After [connecting your app](/connect/connect-an-application-via-an-orm) to ReadySet, profile your app performance and identify queries to cache in ReadySet. Generally, it's best to focus on frequent queries that are too slow and/or that are putting unwanted load on your upstream database.

### Enabling metrics
You can use the [pg_stat_statements extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) to retrieve detailed information about the queries running against your Postgres instance.

Connect to your database via the shell. Run the following command to see if pg_stat_statements is installed.

```
SELECT calls, query FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1;
```

If an error is returned, enable pg_stat_statments with the following command:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```
<Callout type="warning">
In some environments, the pg_stat_statements extension may not be available. In that case, run `ALTER SYSTEM SET` shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'; and restart your Postgres instance before re-running the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.
</Callout>

### Identifying queries to cache
To find queries that put the highest load on the database, run:

```
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time from pg_stat_statements WHERE query ILIKE '%SELECT%' order by total_exec_time DESC;
```

To find queries with the highest latency, run:

```
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time from pg_stat_statements WHERE query ILIKE '%SELECT%' order by mean_exec_time DESC;
```

To find the most frequently issued queries, run: 

```
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time from pg_stat_statements WHERE query ILIKE '%SELECT%' order by calls DESC;
```

Once you've identified queries to cache, you can [cache them in ReadySet](/cache/creating-a-cache).
