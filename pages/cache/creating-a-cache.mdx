# Creating a Cache 
​
Once you've [identified queries](/cache/profiling-queries) that can benefit from caching with ReadySet, use ReadySet's custom SQL commands to check if the queries are supported and then to cache supported queries in ReadySet.
​
## Checking query support
​
To view all queries that ReadySet has proxied to the upstream database and check if they can be cached in ReadySet, connect to ReadySet via the shell and run:
​
```
SHOW PROXIED QUERIES;
```
​
This command returns a virtual table with three columns:
​
- **QueryID:** A unique identifier for the query.
- **Proxied Query:** The text of the query being proxied.
- **ReadySet supported:** Whether or not ReadySet can cache the query.
  - If the value is `pending`, check again until you see `yes` or `no`.  If the value remains pending for more than 15 seconds, the query is unsupported.
  - If the value is `yes`, ReadySet can cache the query.
  - If the value is `no`, ReadySet cannot cache the query.
​
​
<Callout type="info">To successfully cache the results of a query, ReadySet must support the SQL features and syntax in the query. For more details, see [SQL Support](/features/supported-sql-syntax.mdx). ​If an unsupported feature is important to your use case, [submit a feature request](https://github.com/readysettech/readyset/issues/new/choose).</Callout>
​
## Cache queries
To cache a query, use:
​
```
CREATE CACHE [ALWAYS] [<name>] FROM <query>;
```
- `<name>` is optional. If a cache is not named, ReadySet automatically assigns an identifier.
- `<query>` is the full text of the query or the unique identifier assigned to the query by ReadySet, as seen in output of `SHOW PROXIED QUERIES`.
- `ALWAYS` is optional. If the `CREATE CACHE` command is executed inside a transaction (e.g., due to an ORM), use `ALWAYS` to run the command against ReadySet; otherwise, the command will be proxied to the upstream database with the rest of the transaction.
​
## View cached queries
To show all queries that have been cached, use:
​
```
SHOW CACHES;
To show a specific cached query, use:
```
```
SHOW CACHES where query_id = <query ID>;
```
This command returns a virtual table with 2 columns:
​
- **Name:** The name assigned to the query by the user, or the ID assigned to the query by ReadySet.
- **Query Text:** The SQL source of the query. This is the canonical structure of the query, not the original SQL passed to ReadySet.
​
## Remove cached queries
To remove a cache from ReadySet, use:
​
```
DROP CACHE <id>
```
- `<id>` is either the name assigned to the query by the user or the ID assigned to the query by ReadySet, as seen in the output of `SHOW CACHES`.
​
After removing a query from ReadySet, any instances of this query will be proxied to the upstream database.
