# Profiling Queries

Before deciding to cache a query, it's worth investigating the performance impact each query has on your application.

One method for doing so:

</Cards>

### Enabling metrics
<Tabs items={['Using pg_stat_statements with Postgres', 'Using ReadySet metrics']}>
<Tab>
You can use the [pg_stat_statements extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) to retrieve detailed information about the queries running against your Postgres instance.

Connect to your database via the shell. Run the following command to see if pg_stat_statements is installed.

```
SELECT calls, query FROM pg_stat_statements LIMIT 1;
```

If an error is returned, enable pg_stat_statments with the following command:

```
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```

<Callout type="warning">In some environments, the pg_stat_statements extension may not be available. In that case, run `ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements';` and restart your Postgres instance before re-running the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.</Callout>

To enable ReadySet metrics, start ReadySet with the following options:

- [`--prometheus-metrics`](/using/cli/readyset/#--prometheus-metrics)
- [`--metrics-address`](/using/cli/readyset/#--metrics-address)

To include query-specific execution metrics, also pass:

- [`--query-log`](/using/cli/readyset/#--query-log)
- [`--query-log-ad-hoc`](/using/cli/readyset/#--query-log-ad-hoc)

You can access ReadySet metrics at `<metrics address>/metrics`, where the metrics address is defined by the [`--metrics-address`](/using/cli/readyset/#--metrics-address) option (default: `0.0.0.0:6034/metrics`).

## Analyzing per-query metrics
<Tabs items={['Using pg_stat_statements with Postgres', 'Using ReadySet metrics']}>
<Tab>
ReadySet can cache many `SELECT` queries.

To find `SELECT` queries with the highest latency, run:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time from pg_stat_statements WHERE query ILIKE '%SELECT%' order by mean_exec_time DESC;
```

Similarly, ReadySet can be used to offload high-impact queries to improve throughput.

To find the most frequently-run `SELECT` queries, run:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time from pg_stat_statements WHERE query ILIKE '%SELECT%' order by calls DESC;
```

To find queries that cause the most total load on the database, run:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time from pg_stat_statements WHERE query ILIKE '%SELECT%' order by total_exec_time DESC;
```
</Tab>

ReadySet metrics are formatted for easy integration with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). However, the quickest way to examine per-query metrics is to use a simple metrics utility written in Python that queries the metrics endpoint and displays latencies for queries received by ReadySet.

1. Download the metrics utility and its `requirements.txt`:

```sql 
curl -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readysettech/docs/main/docs/assets/metrics/metrics.py"
curl -O "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readysettech/docs/main/docs/assets/metrics/requirements.txt"
```

2. Install dependencies for the utility:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set the `HOST` environment variable to the IP address/hostname portion of `--metrics-address`:
```sql 
export HOST="<metrics-host>"
```

4. Run the script with
```sql
python3 metrics.py --host=${HOST}
```

5. Run the script with
```sql
python3 metrics.py --host=${HOST}
```

6. You can filter the output of this script to show only queries displayed in `SHOW PROXIED QUERIES` or `SHOW CACHES` by passing the `--filter-queries` flag and piping the output of those ReadySet commands into the script like so:

```sql 
PGPASSWORD=noria psql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5433 --username=postgres --dbname=noria -c "SHOW CACHES" | python3 metrics.py --filter-queries
```
